## 🚀 Stretch Goals Implemented

- ✅ Drop-shadow filter on SVG logo
- ✅ Smooth transition on link hover (`transition: all 0.3s ease;`)
- ✅ `srcset` attribute for responsive image loading (structure added; no alternate image sizes)

---

## ✅ Validation Notes

- HTML validated via [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- Any ignored warnings are noted (e.g., decorative images with empty alt)

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- `srcset` is included but not functional (no alternate images available)
- Contact form is frontend-only; no backend functionality
