# Portfolio Website Project

## Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website project designed to showcase my skills, projects, and contact details in a professional and accessible way. The site consists of three linked HTML pages — `index.html`, `projects.html`, and `contact.html` — all styled with an external CSS file (`styles.css`). The project meets academic requirements and web development best practices, focusing on semantic HTML, accessibility, responsive design, and clean, maintainable code.

## Features & Highlights

- **File Structure:** The project is organized into a single folder (`portfolio_yourID/`) containing all necessary HTML and CSS files, correctly linked to ensure seamless navigation.
  
- **Navigation:** Each page contains a `<nav>` element with:
  - Links to the other two pages,
  - An in-page anchor link for smooth scrolling,
  - An external link that opens in a new tab with proper security attributes (`target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener"`).

- **Images:** The portfolio includes both raster images (JPEG/PNG) and a simple SVG logo, all with meaningful `alt` text for accessibility. Raster images are responsive, scaling properly on different devices.

- **Table:** The `projects.html` page contains a semantic, accessible table summarizing project skills and features. It uses `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and appropriate `scope` attributes, and includes cells with `rowspan` or `colspan`.

- **Typography & Color:** Two font families (serif and sans-serif) are loaded via CSS. The site uses three types of color notation: named colors, RGB, and HSL for styling text and backgrounds.

- **Layout:** The design features a two-column layout using CSS floats and proper clearing, avoiding flexbox or grid to meet project requirements. It also includes a relatively positioned container with an absolutely positioned child element for layered content.

- **Accessibility & Semantic HTML:** Headings are used logically from `<h1>` to `<h3>`. Content is organized into semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`. Links have descriptive text to aid screen reader users.

- **CSS Styling:** The site employs clean box-model practices with padding, margins, borders, and subtle box-shadows to enhance readability and visual hierarchy. Transitions are used for link hover effects to improve user experience.

- **Responsive Enhancements:** Although multiple image sizes are not yet available, `srcset` attributes are included as placeholders for future responsiveness.

- **Validation & Documentation:** All HTML files have been validated through the W3C validator to ensure standards compliance. This README documents the project scope, design choices, and known limitations.

## Known Limitations

- The `srcset` attribute is present as a placeholder but currently lacks alternative image versions.
- Dark mode and print stylesheets have not yet been implemented but are planned as stretch goals.
